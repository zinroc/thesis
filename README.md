## General Notes
* To configure the names of the input files, look at the first few lines of saturation.py
* The data should be specified in a CSV file, with x first, then y, one entry per row.
* The parameter files can have blank lines and comments (lines starting with a hash), but not inline or indented comments
* The csv extension is sort of a legacy thing. Feel free to call it \*.conf or whatever.
